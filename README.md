#RAT-Man-Shell
RAT-Man-Shell is a very light weight server/client model. also the Server is MultiThreaded and can handle lots of clients. in the ratmanshell command back will return you to client sub menu RAT-Man-Shell is a custom reverse shell. I built this in visual studio 2022 and used dev cmd to compile heres my compile commands -> 

cl /EHsc /Fe:Server.exe Server.cpp ws2_32.lib user32.lib advapi32.lib kernel32.lib        

cl /EHsc /Fe:Client.exe Client.cpp ws2_32.lib user32.lib advapi32.lib

FUD Server and Client bypasses windows 11 av and windows 10 av as of 11/8/2024
